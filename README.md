# my-sapper-tailwind-template

The default [Sapper](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper) template, available for Rollup and webpack.



## Getting started

### Using `degit`

[`degit`](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) is a scaffolding tool that lets you create a directory from a branch in a repository. Use either the `rollup` or `webpack` branch in `sapper-template`:

```bash
# for Rollup
npx degit "pckkkkkk/my-sapper-tailwind" my-app
```

## Bugs and feedback

Sapper is in early development, and may have the odd rough edge here and there. Please be vocal over on the [Sapper issue tracker](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper/issues).
